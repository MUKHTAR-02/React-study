                                            Part 1: About css components

=> In this episode, Akshay Saini told about different Css components which are used in the industry, they are as follows:
    - Material UI
    - Chakra UI
    - Bootstrap
    - SaaS
    - SCSS
    - Tailwind wind (We will study this)

                                            Part 2: Installation of Tailwind css

step 1- Install Tailwind CSS
Install tailwindcss and its peer dependencies via npm, and then run the init command to generate tailwind.config.js.
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
    npx tailwindcss init

step 2 - Configure PostCSS
Create a .postcssrc file in your project root, and enable the tailwindcss plugin.
    {
        "plugins": {
            "tailwindcss": {}
        }
    }

step 3 - Configure your template paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
    content: [
        "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    }

step 4 - Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
Create a ./src/index.css file and add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers.
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

step 5 - Start your build process
Run your build process with npx parcel src/index.html.
    npx parcel src/index.html

                                            Part 3: Start using it                         

=> Just write what kind of style do you want for your element 
    eg: - making an element flex
        <div className="flex"> 
            ... Header component ...
        </div>

        - giving width to an element 
        <img className="w-32" src={IMG_URL}/>

        - giving padding-right and hover "underline" effect 
        <li className="pr-4 hover:underline"> <Link to="/">Home</Link> </li> 

        - giving the specific size
        <div className="res-card p-4 w-[250px]">        // by wrapping inside the square bracket "[]" we can give our required specific size...

                                            *** Note *** 
    => Here size measurement in tailwind css: 
        4 unit of tailwind == 1 rem 
            that means, w-32 == 8 rem (width)
        and 4 px == 1 unit of tailwind
            that means, w-1 == 4 px (width)

    => Download the VS Code extension for tailwind to make the life easier,
        - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (sometimes this extension doesn't give the suggestions, there's a bug init, so just press 'ctrl + space' then it will again start to give the suggestions)

=> Pros And Cons of Tailwind CSS:
    - PROS: 
        1 -> Light weight (It only import those classes which we have used in our project)
            eg: 
            - Suppose in our project we used [m, p, flex, border, hover] classes so Tailwind will import only these classes it will not import other than these classes like shadow, trasition etc
            - and also if we used 4 times 'm' (margin class) then it will not import 'm' class 4 times, just import only 1 time 

        2 -> Faster Development (since it is directly written inside JSX)
        3 -> Can implement easily anything which we want (Light/dark mode, complex UIs etc)

    - CONS:
        1 -> Initial learning curve
        2 -> Sometimes the CSS code goes too long (Horizontally) if we are adding so many designs
